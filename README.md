# Design of Approximate Multipliers and Adders Using Majority Logic

This project explores the design and implementation of low-power, approximate arithmetic units using majority logic, targeting energy-efficient hardware for edge and embedded systems. By compromising on exact computation, these designs achieve reduced area and power consumption while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

## ðŸ§  Overview

Traditional digital multipliers and adders are accurate but resource-intensive. This project focuses on majority logic-based arithmetic units that reduce power, delay, and hardware complexity, making them ideal for low-power and real-time applications.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Approximate full adder and compressor design using majority logic.
- Four adder variants (`MLAFA11`, `MLAFA22`, `MLAFA12`, `MLAFA21`) and compressor configurations tested.
- Selected best-performing adder (`MLAFA21`) and compressor (`MLAC11`) based on MAE and NMED.
- Designed an approximate multiplier integrating selected components.
- Simulated and verified using Xilinx Vivado.
- Implemented on Basys-3 FPGA for real-time testing.
